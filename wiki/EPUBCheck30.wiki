= EPUBCheck 3.0 Information =

== About ==

!EpubCheck 3.0 is the continuation of the !EpubCheck 1.2 project, upgraded to support validation of [http://idpf.org/epub/30 EPUB 3.0] content besides the legacy [http://idpf.org/epub/201 EPUB 2.0]. 

At the time of this writing, the available build is considered stable and recommended for both EPUB 2.0(1) and 3.0 validation.

Besides supporting both EPUB 2 and 3, another new feature added to !EpubCheck 3.0 is _single file validation_. Currently, the following types are supported: OPF/Package Documents, XHTML, SVG, Navigation Documents and Media Overlay documents (the latter two naturally are only supported in EPUB 3.0 mode).

!EpubCheck 3.0 also supports validation of an unzipped EPUB with the possibility to save the created EPUB archive. Note that if your unzipped input EPUB is found to be invalid, then the created archive will be discarded.


== Running ==

To run the tool you need java (1.6 or above). Any Operating System should do.

Wiki page [Running Running EpubCheck] provides detailed information about running epubcheck in all its different modes.

= Running !EpubCheck for Web =

*!EpubCheck for Web* is a simple web interface for !EpubCheck. It can be deployed using any servlet-compatible web server, such as [http://tomcat.apache.org Apache Tomcat]. Note that you need Java version no less than 1.5.

To run !EpubCheck on the web server, select a .war extension download. You may want to rename it, as the name is typically used as a base path for the web app. Drop the war file where your sever expects to find web applications (e.g. C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 6.0\webapps). If your file was named epubcheck.war, you should be able to point your browser to http://your-server/epubcheck and see a simple web page to upload epub file.

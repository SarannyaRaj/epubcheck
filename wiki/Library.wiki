= Using !EpubCheck as a library =

You can use !EpubCheck as a library in your Java application. !EpubCheck public interfaces can be found in `com.adobe.epubcheck.api` package. `EpubCheck` class can be used to instantiate a validation engine. Use one of its constructors and then call `validate()` method. `Report` is an interface that you can implement to get a list of the errors and warnings reported by the validation engine (instead of the error list being printed out).

Regular .jar download contains all you need to use !EpubCheck as a library.

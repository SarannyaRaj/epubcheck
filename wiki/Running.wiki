= Running !EpubCheck =

To run the tool you need java (1.6 or above). Any OS should do. Run it from the command line:

{{{
java -jar epubcheck-3.0.jar file.epub
}}}

All detected errors are simply printed to stderr.

== Advanced mode ==

EpubCheck can also validates single EPUB internal files or expanded (unzipped) publications:

{{{
java -jar epubcheck-3.0.jar file -mode MODE -v VERSION
}}}

where MODE must be one of the following:

 * `opf` for package document validation;
 * `nav` for navigation document validation (available only for version 3.0);
 * `mo` for media overlay validation (available only for version 3.0);
 * `xhtml`;
 * `svg`;
 * `exp` for Expanded EPUB validation; 

When using -mode exp, one could add an extra flag -save to save the created archive upon validation.

Additional flags:

	-help displays a help message;

Note that when validating a single file, only a subset of the available tests is run. Also, when validating a full EPUB, both mode and version are ignored.
